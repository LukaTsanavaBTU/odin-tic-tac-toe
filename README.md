# Tic-Tac-Toe

A local two-player tic-tac-toe game. The scores of the players are tracked.
Made for an assignment in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-tic-tac-toe).

### What I Practiced While Working On The Project
- Using IIFEs (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions);
- Using Factory Functions;
- Using Objects;
- Designing and creating the page design using HTML/CSS.
